You should see a blank page at first, just — click — to see a super sweet animation.\r\n\r\n## Game Play\r\n- Click on two adjacent squares to have them switch places.\r\n- When 4 squares create a diamond, the diamond will collapse.\r\n\r\nThe game is never ending right now.  Fun!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
