# 404 Page Game Concept

## Introduction
This was a game that I made for a 404 page concept once.  You should see a blank page at first, just — click — to see a super sweet animation.

## Game Play
- Click on two adjacent squares to have them switch places.
- When 4 squares create a diamond, the diamond will collapse.

The game is never ending right now.  Fun!
